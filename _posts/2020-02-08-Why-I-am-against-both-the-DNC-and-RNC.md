We have concentrated too much power in the hands of those least suited to wield it and wonder why they screw up everything they touch.  In the spirit of "compromise" and "doing something", we are provided bigger problems instead of solutions.

The solution to abuse of power is not even more power in someone else's hands.

The solution to government corruption is not more government. 

We were warned about unchecked government authoritarianism during and in the days follwoing WW2.  For the last 75 years we have ignored the warnings. 

We ALL need to stand against the monster we have allowed our goernemnts become, restrict their power, and hold them individually accountable for their actions.  We need to do this at every level and no matter which party they claim to represent.  Failing to do so is how we got here.
