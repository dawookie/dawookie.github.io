Today is Veterans Day.  It is a day to thank those that have ever volunteered to stand in front of the darkness on behalf of the American poeple.  Some of us never left the Continental US and others will never return.

Some of the Veteran news for today is:

* California starts issuing special [Veteran Licenses and ID][cadmv].  
* [Starbucks has extended it tuition assistance][sbux] program to include the offspring and spouses of its employees that are veterans.
