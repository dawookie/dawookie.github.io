The first question is that of self ownership.

Do we have full self ownership or are we serfs subject to the whims and desires of someone else?  There is no middle ground.

As noted by Thomas Jefferson 239 years ago, "Governments derive their just power from the consent of those governed."  It appears that our governments at all levels, as led by the two major parties, no longer care for "just power" and only seek power.  

Many of our civil institutions have proven most uncivil.  They have disenfranchised wide swaths of the population simply for being different in some manner.  Those that abuse government power are shielded from consequences.  

Many are ridiculed for simply demanding autonomy.  Others are punished for pointing out systemic abuses.  This serves to further reinforce government power and the civic serfdom of the masses.
